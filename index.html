    <section id="about" color: ><h2>About</h2><p>I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems at Northeastern University, with over 4.5 years of results-driven experience in consultative roles at Dell Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and Accenture. My expertise includes cloud computing, virtualization, web development, and technical support, all executed with confidence and adaptability.
        At Dell Technologies, I led large-scale migration projects, including V2V migrations for 2,000+ virtual machines for Atos Siemens, automating processes to enhance efficiency. I also managed critical migrations for NBN and Parexel, delivering seamless results that elevated client satisfaction. At TCS, I coordinated the Google YouTube TV project, driving team collaboration and timely delivery, while at Accenture, I ensured asset compliance and developed responsive websites, achieving high success rates in issue resolution.
        Passionate about leveraging technology for transformative change, I thrive in fast-paced, evolving environments. Letâ€™s connect to discuss innovations or explore impactful collaborations!</p></section>
